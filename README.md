# Sparky4j-core-3D
This is a work-in-progress (Currently on 2D implemented) implementation of the of the 3D in the engine (Up to commit 72)

This uses the original code and some JNI(Java Native Interface) for using the Engine inside Java!

# How to use
Currently there is no Sandbox project, But you can easily use the project with all the wrapper code inside or compile the wrapper to a Jar, link it to another project, and link the binaries to it.

* Note that the DLLs are compiled for 32bit. So you might need to download 32bit JDK
