# Sparky4j-core-3D
This is a work-in-progress implementation of the of the 3D in the engine (Up to commit 72)

This uses the original code and some JNI(Java Native Interface) for using the Engine inside Java!

After alot of optimization, The engine has about the same as the if you would to use the C++ engine! Of course I am still working to optimize the engine even more!

# How to use
Right now it crashes in KERNELBASE.dll from some reason...

* Note that the DLLs are compiled for 32bit. So you might need to download 32bit JDK
